"""
Evidence Grounding Module for Gran Sabio LLM Engine
====================================================

This module implements the Strawberry evidence grounding system for detecting
procedural hallucination (confabulation) by measuring whether the model actually
relied on cited evidence.

Phase 2 Implementation:
- ClaimExtractor: Extracts atomic, verifiable claims from generated content

Phase 3 Implementation:
- EvidenceMatcher: Matches claims to evidence spans in context
- spanize_context: Divides context into labeled spans (S0, S1, etc.)
- Span classification (assertion/question/instruction/empty)
- Span scrubbing for pseudo-prior calculation

Phase 4 Implementation:
- BudgetScorer: Calculates budget gaps using logprobs
- kl_bernoulli: KL divergence for Bernoulli distributions
- extract_yes_probability: Extract P(YES) from logprobs

Phase 5 Implementation:
- GroundingEngine: Orchestrates full pipeline, integrates with QA engine
- get_effective_order: Auto-calculates execution order based on on_flag
